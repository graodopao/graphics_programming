# BEGINNINGS

    [05/01/2024] I haven't really ever written a devlog before, so bear with me. Today I decided to start on writing the devlogs for my journey, mostly because I'm about to go on a 24 hours car trip and I'm somewhat anxious about it and can't sleep.

    I decided to start learning graphics programming after watching many videos from The Cherno (mostly the raytracing series), and Acerola's case studies, as well as some technologies I've been seeing every now and then. This, and getting amazed over graphics in games I've played, has sparkled a lot of interest on the subject for me, and I'd like to give it a try!

    It's also worth mentioning that, aside for a few small projects using SDL2, I have no experience with C++, which is the language I'll be using. With that in mind, I'll also be leaning it as I learn graphics programming, following The Cherno's C++ series, and learncpp.com.



    I think a good way to step into this journey is to pick an API to learn, and after much thought, I've chosen OpenGL! At first, I thought about going for Vulkan first, as it's much more verbose and allows you to understand in more details what it is doing, but I figured I'd probably just end up getting overwhealmed trying to understand each piece of code and not pay attention to the theory behind it all.

In order to learn OpenGL, I'll be following the tutorial at learnopengl.com, and check other resources along the way (I'll be referencing them as I go).

    

    Anyway! It's already very late, and I should get rested up, but I'm very excited about learning more about graphics! I hope to get back to my studies soon
